	Variables can be set in DeployStudio variables window when running script.
	BackupRestore Variables:
	-q Unique Identifier.
			Enter the MAC address of the backup you want to restore.
			For example, if you backup a computer and its MAC address
			was: 000000000001. You can then specify that MAC as the
			variable to restore to a different computer.
	-v Target volume
			Specify full path to mount point of volume
			Default is the \$DS_LAST_RESTORED_VOLUME volume
			e.g. "/Volumes/Macintosh HD"
	-u User path on target
			Set to path of users on volume
			Default is /Users
	-r Backup Repository Path
			Set to path of the backup volume
			Default is the DS Repository
			e.g. "/Volumes/NFSDrive/Backups"
