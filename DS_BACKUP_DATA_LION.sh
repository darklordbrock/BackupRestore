# Script to backup home folders on volume before restoring disk image with DeployStudio

    Variables can be set in DeployStudio variables window when running script.
    BackupRestore Variables:
    -q Unique Identifier 
			Enter the MAC address of the backup you want to restore.
			For example, if you backup a computer and its MAC address
			was: 000000000001. You can then specify that MAC as the
			variable to restore to a different computer.
		 	Read Me has more information on its use.
	-c Remove User Cache
			Will delete the Users /Library/Cache
	 		folder before backing up the data.
    -e Users to Skip
            Must use quotes for multiple users
            Default is "guest" and "shared"
                You must specify "guest" and
                "shared" if your use the argument
    -v Target volume
            Specify full path to mount point of volume
            Default is the internal volume
            e.g. /Volumes/Macintosh HD
    -u User path on target
            Set to path of users on volume
            Default is /Users

## To Do
#
# Switch to Serial Number?
# Plan for "Deleted Users" folder
# Log paths to backup folders
# Backup More User Records?? 
# 	/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/sharepoints/User Public Folder.plist
# 	groups/com.applesharepoint.group.[12].plist
# 	Restore _lpadmin.plist access, _appserveradm.plist, _appserverusr.plist, 

## Changes
# 
# Thursday, December, 1, 2011 - v0.7.2
# 	- Removing code for Lion testing
# 	- Backing up dslocal user.plist instead of all the records individually.
# 	- Added in ditto for backing up the home. Credit to Miles Muri for the code.
#	- Miles Muri also submitted a lot of code and comments that helped prep for Lion. Thank You!
# 
# Wednesday, June, 22, 2011 - v0.7.1
#	- Added flag to remove user cache folder before backing up home.
# 	- Testing new DS_INTERNAL_DRIVE variable command.
# 
# Tuesday, April, 19, 2011 - v0.7
# 	- Updated code to use new user deliminator from '.' to '-'
# 
# Saturday, April, 16, 2011 - v0.6
# 	- Lots of little error fixes from midnight coding.
# 	- Tried to unify script messages
# 
# Monday, April, 14, 2011 - v0.5
#	- Change name of user plists and home backups to account for names with '.' in them.
# 
# Monday, March, 28, 2011 - v0.4.7
# 	- Moved dscl and internal directory variables outside and above for loop. 
#	- Uncommented test variables. Easier to troubleshoot the script.
# 
# Tuesday, March 22, 2011 - v0.4.6
# 	- Filevault restores done with first boot scripts
# 	- Removed extra plist created with backup tool name. If I need this, I'll use the same plist as the user details.
# 	- Added AuthenticationAuthority and HomeDirectory to plist backup
# 	- Some dscl and PlistBuddy errors show when running scripts, this is normal.
# 	- Added "deleted users" folder to exclude list
# 
# Friday, March 18, 2011 - v0.4.5
# 	- Changed test for mobile/network accounts, again. Now seems to work!
# 
# Wednesday, Febuary 09, 2011 - v0.4.4
# 	- Adding to git
# 	- Added rsync as an backup tool option
# 	- Removed Unique ID from user data, its only used for the backup folder.
# 	- Changed test for mobile/network accounts. Should work better.
# 
# Tuesday, February 01, 2011
# 	- Bug fixing the tar and ditto backups and variables
# 
# Monday, January 31, 2011
# 	- Added flag to backup using ditto or tar, check help
# 
# Thursday, January 27, 2011
# 	- Chenged the way we check for network and mobile accounts. Now looking at dscl for OriginalNodeName
# 		Thanks to hunterbj
#
# Tuesday, January 18, 2011
# 	- Adding variables that can be set within DeployStudio
#		Icluding: Users to skip, Target volume, User path on target, and Backup destination
# 
# Monday December 20, 2010 
# 	- Fixed issue with user account not showing in system preferences after restoring.
# 	- Added support for restoring admin rights for network users

# How to Backup Filevault homes
# 	Filevault accounts have GeneratedUID
# 	dscl . read /Users/file HomeDirectory | awk '{print $2}'
# 	Backup sparseimage
# 	/Users/file/file.sparsebundle
# 	- Backup keychain master passwords and cert
# 	- /Library/Keychain/FileVaultMaster.cer
# 	- /Library/Keychain/FileVaultMaster.keychain
# 	Recreate user - Wonder if its necessary to restore the accounts?
# 	/System/Library/CoreServices/ManagedClient.app/Contents/Resources/createmobileaccount -n usershortname
# 	Restore sparesimage

# Credit to Pete Akins and his amazingly awesome createUser.pkg script. 
# It was instrumental in learning how to backup and create users.

# ****** Rusty's musings on ditto ******
# Create sparsedisk image with options for quota? size? 
# hdiutil create -size 1g -type SPARSE -fs HFS+ -volname "$USERZ" "$DS_ARCHIVE.ditto.dmg
# hdiutil attach "$DS_ARCHIVE.ditto.dmg"
# -z backups up with gzip -j flag will compress it with bzip2 and -k will use PKZip
# /usr/bin/ditto -vXcz --keepParent "$DS_BACKUP" "$DS_ARCHIVE.cpio.gz" && echo -e "Home successfully backed up using ditto" || echo -e "Could not back up home"
# ****** Rusty's musings on ditto ******

# ****** Rusty's musings on detecting mobile and local accounts ******
## Old way to check for network and mobile accounts. The idea is that local accounts have a UID < 1000 and network accounts are greater than 1000. May not hold true universally.
# UserID=`"$dscl" -f "$INTERNAL_DN" localonly -read "/Local/Target/Users/$USERZ" uid|awk '{print $2}'`
# if [[ "$UserID" -gt "1000" ]]; then #this is a mobile account
## Check dscl for "OriginalNodeName" if its a mobile account. If the account doesn't exist, its a network account. 
# if [[ `"$dscl" -f "$INTERNAL_DN" localonly -read "/Local/Target/Users/$USERZ" dsAttrTypeStandard:OriginalNodeName|grep -E "^OriginalNodeName:"` ]]; then #this is a mobile account
## Another Method that should work: check the Authentication Authority for ShadowHash. Only local accounts have it.
# if [[ `"$dscl" -f "$INTERNAL_DN" localonly -read "/Local/Target/Users/$USERZ" dsAttrTypeStandard:AuthenticationAuthority|grep -E "Shadow"` ]]; then #this is a local account
## Check for PrimaryGroupID of 20. All local users should have the ID of 20, DS accounts will be different. Probably not the best way to check. Broken in 10.7
# if [[ `"$dscl" -f "$INTERNAL_DN" localonly -read "/Local/Target/Users/$USERZ" dsAttrTypeStandard:PrimaryGroupID|grep -E "20"` ]]; then #this is a local account
# ****** Rusty's musings on detecting mobile and local accounts ******

## local accounts don't work in 10.7 yet anyway...
## dscl doesn't work much... changed to not falsely id local accounts
## Before, this would spit out a bunch of error messages, but since it 
## wasn't equal to "OriginalAuthenticationAuthority", then it thought it 
## was local. It wasn't. :-(
## this should work if dscl worked.
## TODO - make this work with another tool to check network accounts
## id -n might work with | to sed, I'm not well enough versed...
